# Border Pass VER 1
Register your business trip's border crossings with ease.

This web app allows to register border crossings to anyone who needs to calculate his subsistence allowance for cross-border business trips.
Version 1 uses browser's localStorage to store all user data as well as app state between subsequent runs as no backend is implemented yet.
This app is PWA compliant which makes it installable on mobile devices and can be used offline.

Tech stack:
- frontend built with React
- Context API used to manage app state
- React Hooks 
- Parcel used to bundle all the assets
- RWD and mobile-first approach
- SASS preprocessor
